when a variable which is note meant to be edited later or messed with name it in ALL_CAPITAL_AND_WITH_UNDERSCORE
make the code in functions for reusability and less messy code
always try to make functions with return value
name parameters a bit different from global variables for better readability
try to encapsulate program in functions
try not to use global variables rather when creating functions put them in.try to make functions less dependent on each other 
and make then rather work on 1 specific task

try to make code compact using inbuilt functions and librarys

write
if __name__ == "__main__":
    #function calls
    function()
